- Changed "QUANTI" to "QUANTIDE" in the navbar Logo component

[12:36:37 PM] Iteration 2 starting
[12:37:34 PM] Task completed. I have:
1. Pulled three assets from the gh-pages branch: `levr_screenshot.jpg`, `breadcrumb_screenshot.jpg`, and `quantide_logo.jpg`
2. Placed them in the `public/` directory where they'll be available at build time
3. Verified all images are valid JPEG files
4. Confirmed the build still passes
5. Updated the TODO file marking the task complete with notes

There are still pending tasks in the TODO file, so another iteration will handle the next one.

[12:37:36 PM] Iteration 3 starting
[12:38:37 PM] I have completed the task: **Replace placeholder Logo component with actual Quantide logo image**

Changes made:
- Updated the Logo component in `src/App.jsx` to use an `<img>` element pointing to `/quantide_logo.jpg` instead of an SVG with text
- Updated the CSS in `src/App.css` to properly style the logo image with flexbox alignment and a height of 36px
- Build passes successfully

[12:39:52 PM] I've completed the task of updating project cards and modal to use actual screenshot images instead of placeholders.

- Replaced placeholder divs with actual `<img>` elements in both project cards and modal
- Updated CSS to style the images with `object-fit: cover` for proper display
- Build passes successfully
