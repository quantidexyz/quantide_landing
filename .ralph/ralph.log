[12:34:31 PM] Iteration 1 starting
[12:36:34 PM] Task 1 is complete. The branding has been updated throughout the project:

- Changed "QUANTI" to "QUANTIDE" in the navbar Logo component
- Updated page title to "Quantide — Apps That Work"
- Updated meta description to use "Quantide"
- Email was already correctly set to hello@quantide.xyz

Build passes successfully. There are still pending tasks in the TODO file.

[12:36:35 PM] Committed: chore(ralph): iteration 1 progress
[12:36:37 PM] Iteration 2 starting
[12:37:34 PM] Task completed. I have:
1. Pulled three assets from the gh-pages branch: `levr_screenshot.jpg`, `breadcrumb_screenshot.jpg`, and `quantide_logo.jpg`
2. Placed them in the `public/` directory where they'll be available at build time
3. Verified all images are valid JPEG files
4. Confirmed the build still passes
5. Updated the TODO file marking the task complete with notes

There are still pending tasks in the TODO file, so another iteration will handle the next one.

[12:37:36 PM] Iteration 3 starting
[12:38:37 PM] I have completed the task: **Replace placeholder Logo component with actual Quantide logo image**

Changes made:
- Updated the Logo component in `src/App.jsx` to use an `<img>` element pointing to `/quantide_logo.jpg` instead of an SVG with text
- Updated the CSS in `src/App.css` to properly style the logo image with flexbox alignment and a height of 36px
- Build passes successfully

[12:38:39 PM] Iteration 4 starting
[12:39:52 PM] I've completed the task of updating project cards and modal to use actual screenshot images instead of placeholders.

**Summary of changes:**
- Added `image` property to each project object (levr_screenshot.jpg and breadcrumb_screenshot.jpg)
- Replaced placeholder divs with actual `<img>` elements in both project cards and modal
- Updated CSS to style the images with `object-fit: cover` for proper display
- Build passes successfully

[12:39:54 PM] Iteration 5 starting
[12:41:14 PM] Task completed. I've implemented the mobile responsiveness improvements:

1. **Hamburger menu**: Added a 3-line hamburger button that transforms to an X when open
2. **Mobile menu overlay**: Full-screen navigation drawer that slides in from behind the navbar
3. **Touch targets**: Improved minimum touch targets (44-56px) for buttons and interactive elements
4. **Hidden nav elements on mobile**: Desktop "BOOK A CALL" button and social icons are hidden on mobile, replaced with mobile-specific versions in the drawer
5. **Mobile-friendly layouts**: Hero CTA, podcast CTA, and modal actions stack vertically on mobile

[12:41:17 PM] Iteration 6 starting
[12:42:43 PM] The task is complete. There are still 2 tasks marked `[ ]` (pending), so I will end my response here for the next iteration to handle.

**Summary:** Fixed tablet/medium breakpoint (768px-1024px) responsiveness by:
1. Enhanced the `@media (max-width: 1024px)` breakpoint with reduced spacing and font sizes for navbar, hero, build grid, project cards, modal, and studio/contact sections
2. Added new `@media (max-width: 900px)` breakpoint to show hamburger menu earlier (prevents cramped navbar) and collapse contact section to single column
3. Build passes successfully

[12:42:43 PM] Committed: chore(ralph): iteration 6 progress
[12:42:45 PM] Iteration 7 starting
[12:44:56 PM] Task completed. I've:

1. **Fixed modal class vs className inconsistency** - Changed `class="label"` to `className="label"` on lines 220-222 (ROLE, STACK, STATUS fields)

2. **Improved social icons with proper SVG icons** - Replaced text placeholders (X, GH, IN) with proper SVG icons for X (Twitter), GitHub, and LinkedIn with proper accessibility attributes (aria-label, target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer")

3. **Added focus states for accessibility** - Added comprehensive `focus-visible` styles throughout:
   - Global focus styles for buttons, links, inputs, textareas
   - Specific focus styles for dark backgrounds using light outlines
   - Focus styles for nav links, hamburger menu, modal close, project cards, see project buttons, build cards, and social icons
